# Vanilla JS Youtube API Practice
This project will be used for me to practice and refine my vanilla javascript abilities by making use of the Youtube API. 

## Some ideas I may be able to work with:
- [x] Search for a particular keyword.
- [x] display all results (maybe 20-25 at a time or so)
- [x] display results to the UI (in a decent/nice way)
- [x] be able to select individual video results
- [x] add ability to favorite videos and see a full favorites list
- [x] add ability to remove favorites
- [x] display other videos from the creator of individually selected video


## Bugs
- [x] Keyword search does not only return videos but channels, playlists, etc. Need to parse out anything thats not a video.
