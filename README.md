# Vanilla JS Youtube API Practice
This project will be used for me to practice and refine my vanilla javascript abilities by making use of the Youtube API. 

## Some ideas I may be able to work with:
- [x] Search for a particular keyword.
- [x] display all results (maybe 20-25 at a time or so)
- [x] display results to the UI (in a decent/nice way)
- [ ] be able to select individual video results
- [ ] display other videos from the creator of individually selected video
- [ ] add ability to favorite videos and see a full favorites list
